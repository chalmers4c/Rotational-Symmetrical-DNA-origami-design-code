# Rotational-Symmetrical-DNA-origami-design-code
This git contains the information about the rotational symmetry DNA origami design and code for calculation on the bridge staples distance.

# Background
The DNA origami is a type of programmable DNA nanostructures with nucleotide level accuracy. The design of origami itself follows different rules. The basic rule to design classic 2D and 3D origamis can be found here: https://doi.org/10.6028/jres.126.001. Here I am focused on a special type of DNA origmai that is made to be rotational symmetrical, first published by Tikhomirov et al. in 2011 in the paper "Programmable disorder in random DNA tilings" (https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2016.256). Shortly followed the publication, Tikhomirov et al. drew the world's first microscale Mona Lisa painting with this DNA origami tile in the paper "Fractal assembly of micrometre-scale DNA origami arrays with arbitrary patterns" (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24655).
